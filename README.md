# Detection Of Cars Using Mask-RCNN and Supervisely

Mask RCNN is a deep neural network aimed to solve instance segmentation problem in machine learning or computer vision. In other words, it can separate different objects in a image or a video. You give it a image, it gives you the object bounding boxes, classes and masks

We all know how _*'Efficient and Intriguing'*_ Mask RCNN is. We've all seen people getting tickets for over speeding along with their photos being clicked. We know how the radar speed gun efficiently does its job. Here we use Mask RCNN to detect cars on the highway.

I know it sounds bland and boring, but here we use [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/), a tool that automatically annotates your dataset for you i.e. implements instance segmentation aka. mask

What Supervisely does is, It uses its own AI to augment and mask your dataset and uses pre-trained ML models at its disposal.

The only drawback is that, it needs an Agent, i.e. a machine that has:

1. Linux OS-Kernel 3.10
2. NVIDIA Cuda 9.0
3. NVIDIA-Docker 2.0
4. Docker 18.0
